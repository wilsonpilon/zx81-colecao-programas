v0.01 Changes 4-Sept-07

lots of changes, rewrites, features and bugs!

The line editor now has keyboard repeat :) - just like the ZX81 ROM should have had.

All commands now understand paths so you don't need to be in the same directory
as a file to operate on it.  You can now do things like:

delete b:/games/test.p
dir c:/stuff

Each drive now has it's own current working directory, so entering

b:
c:
b:

doesn't take you back to the root of drive b:

We now have real write support.  You can save programs as well as load them!
Commands understood by the CLI are:

<drive letter>:  - Change drive
MOUNT                          - Redetects any changes to the drives. Use 
                                 this command after swapping Compact flash 
                                 cards etc.
 
EXIT                           - Exits back to basic.

CLS                            - Clears the screen.

VER                            - Shows the current version.

CD <path>                      - Change the current working directory to
                                 <path>

MAP <path>                     - Shows the cluster chain for the specified
                                 file.  Mainly for debug/testing purposes.

DELETE <path>                  - Deletes the specified file.

RENAME <path> <file2>          - Renames the file specified to the new filename.

SAVE <path>                    - Saves the current program in memory to the
                                 file specified.

DIR [+S] <path> <path> ...     - Displays the contents of <path>. Normal listing
                                 is to display just the filename, with no extra
                                 information.  with the +S switch, size info
                                 is included.

FAT Filesystem for the ZX81
Version 0.00 pre-release sample Copyright (c) 2007 M Wynne

To test the functionality of the FAT32 filesystem, Start the EightyOne emulator,
then select a ZX81 with the MWCFIde IDE interface.  From the files menu, select
"Drives..." and choose a hard drive image to mount.  A sample image "fattest.vhd"
is provided with the code.  This image was produced by Windows XP running under
the VirtualPC software so is a completely authentic filesystem produced by
a microsoft operating system.

Once set up, start the command line interpreter by entering

RAND USR 32768

at the K prompt.

The system should respond with a number of available drives, and will accept the
following commands:

MOUNT			- Redetects and changes to the drives. Use this command
			  after swapping Compact flash cards etc.

DIR			- Prints the contents of the current directory.

CD <dirname>		- Changes the current directory to that specified.

DELETE <filename>	- Deleted the file specified

RENAME <from> <to>	- Renames the file <from> to <to>

EXIT			- Exits back to BASIC

If a command is not an build in command of the interpreter, it is taken as the
name of a file to run. a .P extension is added the name and the systems attempts
to run the resulting filename.

As an example, if Drive B: has the game MANIC.P in the games subdirectory, to run
it the user would execute:

B:
CD GAMES
MANIC

More to follow...
